# Servo
 INTRODUCTION A servo motor is a rotary actuator or a motor that allows for a  precise control in terms of the angular position, acceleration, and  velocity. Basically it has certain capabilities that a regular motor  does not have. Consequently it makes use of a regular motor and  pairs it with a sensor for position feedback. It is just made up of simple motor which run through servo  mechanism. It can push or rotate an object with great precesion. ï‚· WORKING Servo Motor consists of a DC Motor, a Gear system, a position  sensor, and a control circuit. The DC motors get powered from a  battery and run at high speed and low torque. The Gear and shaft  assembly connected to the DC motors lower this speed into  sufficient speed and higher torque. The position sensor senses the  position of the shaft from its definite position and feeds the  information to the control circuit. The control circuit accordingly  decodes the signals from the position sensor and compares the  actual position of the motors with the desired position and  accordingly controls the direction of rotation of the DC motor to  get the required position. Servo Motor generally requires a DC  supply of 4.8V to 6 V.
